wallet is right here I just don't have enough money money so I cannot you come back tomorrow with passport transfer information I can help but is there only I'm sorry we are closed [Music] now I mean this has the potential to go the same way as the money exchange shop I had to show a Passport just check into a hotel in istan yeah me too but I think that whole like asking to stay for free thing could be the bigger problem then there's [Music] that wait wait wait okay you ask why me cuz you got to to right from the watch guy so that means it's your turn no that means you're better at it than me and uh well we only have one impression of me so hi about come uh we have a problem that I was hoping maybe you could help us with are your guests here no but we would like to be you see we were on

to right so do I yeah well this whole Fiasco could cost me my job what are you doing trying to figure out this credit card mess [Music] showers free any luck with your credit cards well they said it's not working cuz I'm overseas I thought they were supposed to work worldwide yeah you would think so are you sure it's not a problem with the uh uh you know your balance no there's not a problem with the uh balance they said that because I didn't call them before I went out of the country that my charges would be flagged as fraudulent even though it's legitimate and you told them that everything is fine yeah that doesn't make any sense that's what I told them but apparently they are working on it and it should be fixed by sometime tomorrow so what about your other card sadly it's through the same bank so same problem yeah exactly all right I'm going to get in the shower all right I'm going to go to sleep so I guess you can have the bed and I'll take the floor okay sh is [Music] [Music] dead tourists [Music] oh no [Music] hi uh I spoke to someone at the hotel last night is he there okay I'm sorry I don't understand anything you're saying um look did he leave any word about uh tour company or maybe Ephesus yeah yeah Ephesus hello hello she hung up on me your hotel yeah did you find out any more information about the tour company or the name of it I mean then we could just call ourselves no all I understood was the word sick no and Ephesus which she just repeated over and over again what about you what about me well your hotel or how do you arrange the tour I just saw a pamphlet and called I don't actually have a hotel back in istanbull I checked out for this tour hello you must leave now the manager will be here soon so what do we do now I don't know we should probably try to get to the US Embassy I mean our things may be long gone at least they can get us what we need to get home do you have any educated guesses on where the closest Embassy might be a symbol yeah exactly okay we will make our way there then uh hope the tour company has our stuff and then if not we'll go to the Embassy so glad you pointed that out you know will you stop it what stop acting like it's all my fault I hate to point out the obvious but okay then stop acting like I'm some ditsy clumsy fool it was an accident and I didn't force you to get off the bus and I didn't tell the bus driver to leave you and ever since then all I have tried to do is whatever it takes to just get us back to our lives [Music] don't stop here I'm thirsty well I really think that we should save the money that you have not at the risk of getting dehydrated plus I need to see if my cards work okay well I'm I'm doing the math in my head and we're not going to have enough money if your cards don't work cross your fingers hi uh four Waters please no the shot uh um all right just two we have a little left enough until my cards get fixed thank you thank [Music] you did I get one of those yeah here excuse me what I think that guy just took my wallet what that guy just took my wallet what hey hey wait did you see where he went I don't know great this trip just keeps getting better okay well the joke's on him you didn't have any almost any cash in your wallet and I mean your cards don't work so yeah until later today when we could really use them hey ch it'll be okay [Music] somehow oh look how cute this place is yeah adorable too bad we can't afford it hello hi hungry I mean yes but we don't have any money come it oh it sit thank you [Music] e not quite what you expected I bet yeah but it was really kind of her and well I would love to have standards you're hungry don't judge [Music] me it's not gross it's it's food it's uh it's clerk intake necessary it's necessary necessary no you know what I can't do it okay it's not going to hurt you and you don't know that ah the human body is pretty adeptive fighting off bacteria don't say that word trust me you'll be fine how do you know that I'm a vet fine fine don't believe me I'd believe what you say about animals well I'm pretty sure that I still have a degree with word doctor in [Music] it okay okay you're going to feel better once your stomach is full enough and that angry feeling goes away [Music] not bad thanks and hope I'm sorry for not making this any easier I know you didn't mean for this to happen apology accepted thanks so IST do you think we can hit rides to get there maybe um I mean I'm Not The Backpacker type but we have gotten this far so why are you here anyway I mean in this country I um I was a guest speaker at a conference what topic it's kind of technical okay um basically data mining while navigating privacy concerns within Cloud Technologies sounds riveting yeah did it not go well or no it was fine oh sorry you just said that your job was at risk so I thought that oh no it's uh it's complicated oh sorry we can't pay it's fine thank you kind of restores your faith in humanity huh yeah any luck no still won't turn on how serious were you about hitchiking semi I'm going to go ask this guy yeah but what if he's criminal well I I was going to saying what if he's not going to Istanbul one way to find out excuse me hi um we need to get to Istanbul uh we need a ride could you uh drive us to Istanbul no English Okay um uh Istanbul uh you go to Istanbul right what is it a translation app clever did you tell him yeah see me typing just making [Music] sure I have some more deliveries to make but then I'm going 100 km in that direction I'm not going to istanb but I could take you to that point yes thank you yes please yeah okay thank you oh uh wait [Music] um what are you doing I'm asking where we are that oh okay thank you I'll s oh I can keep it oh oh thank you have a good day okay um so where are we we are here so I think North is uh I think we have to go that way wait hold on what I think that this is uh what I think it's one of the places that we were supposed to stop on the tour it is come on let's go could the bus be here [Music] any sign of the tour group all the buses out front were gone and it took us all day to get here unfortunately probably all long gone by now well we should probably get going to then hey can I take a few minutes here please sure what is this place anyways uh it's an ancient military fort okay that's pretty cool yeah I just wish I had my camera [Music] so what's with the envelope they're letters they're all letters my mom she came here when she was younger and she loved it why was she here to explore to be on her own I think that's when she talks about how strong the walls are and the idea that the fort protected people for centuries and it made her feel safe I think she was nervous about traveling on her own this place how did she put it she she felt like she got strength from here that she took with her H it's pretty neat did you write all the letters when is here uh no she wrote them a few months ago before she passed away I'm so sorry it's okay my uh dad gave them to me with instructions from her not to open them until I got to the place with the name on the front of them things weren't very settled until recently with my dad so this was the earliest I felt like I could come so if she came here does that mean the other letters are from other spots on the tour yeah most of them that's why I chose the tour wow well it's an amazing gift she left to you yeah yeah it [Music] is thanks for stopping back there it was cool I'm glad we did I mean we might as well enjoy something on this trip right yeah I think maybe we just keep on this way try to get to the next town okay I'll keep an eye out for a ride coold aren you not really my feet are killing me it's a like could think about all of these Hills and Roads that we've pass in still no Town can't turn back I know but oh a car wait hey over here see drunk are you okay yeah um [Music] thank [Music] you I uh I think maybe we should stop and find a place you know off the road for tonight yeah good idea what is this place no idea did you see a sign m- oh look at this try the door um it's locked okay not a bad place to stop all right let's try over there I missed my hotel I know what you mean at least it's peaceful out here yeah did you tell what that was yeah an animal wow that that degree it's it's really helped do you have any pets fish that's it I love my patience but when I come home I need a break kind of like how a pizza maker when he comes home purposely doesn't eat pizza and that's your analogy yeah it works if you say so so do you have any pets no I had a dog growing up it was CH is just this big massive ball of f an energy what was his name CH my sister named him sure so where else in the country did your mom visit you know what you wrote you about Troy she loved big mythology I actually already went there before the Ephesus tour like the uh saltan Ned in isol where you can see the haa Sophia and the Blue Mosque there's a sister in there too but I saved that one for last that's nice she talked about a lot of places in our LS some even more amazing but not all of them got letters did she ever tell you about them like when you were growing up no not really we uh we argued a lot say that we didn't get along is an understatement was that when you were a kid no whole life I mean we were cordial during the holidays but we could have tried more should have tried more I'm sure it wasn't just you though yeah me it takes too right what' you say about Troy um she like to imagine Helen and Paris and all of the commotion that their relationship start up in the battle with mle house met [Music] leas she wondered about the Trojan Horse who wouldn't I don't know surprisingly she was romantic about it what's surprising about that I mean wasn't the whole thing some like big romantic Affair yeah but she was just so no nonsense and the side of her was just fanciful I me if that's the right word maybe she had more heart than she let on H [Music] maybe still cold I'll be fine you'll be cold I still have long [Music] sleeves thank you you're welcome [Music] good night Jack good night hope [Music] so just thinking ahead for tonight we have got to find a way to clean ourselves up so we can sleep so we're more civilized no argument there but that does take money so well uh keep your eyes open for a way we can make some quick cash then you all right yeah just checking smart I keep thinking I should try to find a way to call work but I don't know that it' make a difference why not well I'm supposed to be in the office tomorrow and I could think of a few people that will know I'm not there not in a good way well so they wouldn't understand all of this more like they'd use it to get what they want which is what to see me fired really yeah I found out my boss sent me here to Turkey to just get me out of the way I've been working on something and it's getting a lot of attention like really really good attention and turns out he wants it for himself no yeah when we're in Ephesus I got a call from my buddy Mark um he's a cooworker and he actually let me know that they were interviewing for my position right behind my back wait so that's why you have to get back back yeah I don't know if it'll make a difference but figured I should try right you have to at least stand up for yourself yeah that's the plan look what is that a Turkish bath house isn't that just like a spa uh no it's really more of like a cultural thing although it's probably spot-like in more of the rtier resorts definitely not my thing oo well that would definitely solve one of our problems hello come please come have you a Turkish bus oh uh no uh we would like to but I I don't think we can you can't come to Turkey and not have a true Turkish bus oh uh we don't have any money yeah oh oh what happened to your arm it's flaw I slipped I mean do you run this place by yourself because that would be really difficult yes Som days yes maybe we can help you help yeah maybe we could do cleaning or help with whatever else you need you yeah and then in exchange we could use the facilities and 600 L 5 l [Music] dear you go there uh stay please it's for you but first clean then you can bus okay I [Music] will you're there [Music] M what [Music] this is the best uh I'm all done with these where do you want me to put them oh there is this a lost and found mhm hey how'd it go um disturbing well we got paid and I got a tip for scrubbing some guys back really that's uh I don't want to talk about it well maybe this will make you feel better where did you get that lost found okay so obviously you've been through an experience but we've got money now so maybe we can find a place to stay tonight sounds good uh where uh maybe um oh maybe I bed and breakfast okay but no bartering okay I don't want to clean anything or anyone ever again don't worry you don't have to taada so you're telling me you got this room for 500 L 4 50 I bargained you what I bargained not Bartered and because of the extra 100 from your tip we can go out for a nice simple dinner very simple other good news breakfast is included you're kidding you're welcome okay so we've actually made pretty good progress considering the fact that we could have just driven a whole lot faster with our imaginary cab or rental are yes uh but worse comes to worse it looks like we could walk this in a day or two let's hope it doesn't come to that if we get the right ride we can be inable tomorrow morning really yeah but if not we need to make it to that point there and that'd be good progress you know this is pretty close to one of the original stops in the tour if I'm reading this right which one the bizaar Grand Bazaar I'm pretty sure that's in Istanbul no there are bazaars everywhere this is one of those enticing spend all your money kind of stops that they have on every tour but it's one that your mom wrote about yeah but I mean it's okay I can just go on my own you don't have to oh no no no it's fine um we should probably stick together but uh first food [Music] please I say we use all the money we have left that won't be hard but what happened to saving it oh I don't know I figured that you probably wouldn't want to work for another meal and not to be overly confident but things have gone pretty good so far I mean could be worse no don't jinx it all right I got to ask how did you become such a good bargainer or is that the word m negotiator sure you know what I mean I I got it from my mom she used to take us to thrift stores as kids you know to get school stuff or whatever and she would bargain with the thrift store employees I would get so embarrassed I mean I get it if something's overpriced or if it's in bad condition but then trying to get a dollar off of a used skirt I mean I for one would love to see you embarrassed I bet you would I dreaded going and the thing is like everything was fair game with her if you hated it so much what changed cuz now you are really good at it I don't know maybe it's just the choice of haggling or going without here maybe I'm more confident than I thought I was maybe I'm channeling my mom on this trip so you don't do this back home I there's not really a need to unless I'm buying a car dealerships fear me oh I believe it so what's your secret please teach me your ways oh okay there are three steps to a good negotiation first smile a smile trust me it means that you mean business but you're going to be like cool about it got it [Music] two eye [Music] contact little intense but okay and the third the third a handshake here it has to be firm but not too firm confident but not intimidating just like sealing the deal with a mutual respect it's good hinche I think I'm turned around here actually I think we found it I hope you write your letter of course I just wish I had my wallet there's just so much to see wow [Music] no no we're good we're good dear hope it's been so many years I hope the bizaar is still there I'm wondering if everything I've written still makes sense or if the places I went to change too much to recognize by my descriptions but assuming it's mostly the same learn from my mistakes first watch out for someone taking advantage of the fact you're a foreigner I didn't understand the money fully yet and paid triple for a scarf I ended up giving that scarf away a couple of years later because it bothered me so much second try something new this was the place I discovered Turkish delight not the Box stuff we can get at home covered in powdered sugar but real fresh-made Turkish delight I'm sure the shops Chang but I remember buying some there that became my favorite try [Music] it hey good letter yeah um did you see any Turkish delight shops uh yeah actually down there but we don't have any money I know I just want to see it I'm salivating we just St come on you can't pretend that these don't look delicious which one feel like I'm going to get a cavity just staring that [Music] one little outside our price range well at least now I know why my mom wrote about them just looking at them is [Music] memorable hey I just remembered something that I wanted to check out um I'm going to head back oh okay no no no um you must be tired and the hotel's right there it's okay I I don't mind I'll be quick I promise okay all right be safe [Music] hey I think these are mostly dry thought it'd be nice to have some clean clothes for a change thank you I think I'd like to burn these so what's that it's a little tree here um okay [Music] what how I actually Bartered I um I just thought you shouldn't miss out on anything your mom wanted you to experience [Music] thank you you're welcome you're going to try some right after you try it first and I still don't quite know what they are [Music] so yeah that good mhm all right [Music] wow that is not what I expected huh that's a look yeah thank you lost and found you're not looking too shabby yourself don't you want the bed no you take it this time you sure yeah thanks so what's going to happen if you go back and your job's not there not sure part of me so angry about what's going on I could put up a fight make a big deal out of it but but what I'm afraid I don't stand a chance I mean little me versus the big boss besides I'm away and can't do anything about it he's trying to fire me by the time I get back am I just making it worse for myself I mean maybe if you go quietly he'll owe you not that that's great either worked really hard there I mean if you go back maybe he'll just stop what he's doing I hope so but even if he does I already know what he's done do I really want to stay and War for someone like that you're just making me really glad that I'm self-employed all right question for you now if you could write back to your mom about your experience in Turkey what would you say I would I would tell her I've gotten

hope I remember being upset when I came to these thermal Springs I had talked to my boyfriend at the time and it seemed like everything was doomed between us there I was in a paradise of sorts a landscape so unique and lovely I was just going to hurry and take a roll of pictures and be on my way then I saw it I can still remember the shade of the water and all the Limestone around it was it Limestone I think so I remember soaking the pools and looking over all the Springs it gave me perspective one argument didn't matter Only Hell I felt mattered and I missed him and I wish that he was there with me and that's when I knew things would work out with my boyfriend and it did your father and I got married later that year my favorite spot was in the pools all the way at the bottom make sure to take lots of pictures so your dad can see them love Mom [Music] come on aren't you going to get in I already have my feet in that doesn't count this is amazing come on no when do you ever plan to come back here that's not the point point Come on get in you enjoy but enjoy quick quickly Daylight's wasting and we have another ride to catch okay help me [Music] out really isn't it nice I could

I mean I can't imagine it would make that big of a difference back home a few more hours could could be everything but you don't know that I know I can't take the risk if I have the chance to fight for my career everything I've worked for I have to do it but if hope listen I've wasted enough time with all of this I don't have the luxury of sticking around for a bunch of letters that don't mean anything to me [Music] I'm sorry that was yeah um you should probably you should probably get going listen you know I didn't mean any of and you should call about your wallet being stolen and uh you should take this stop I can't how else are you going to get to istan ball thanks [Music] safe travels [Music] then you too bye [Music] and our next stop this beautiful beach will be our last sight on our tour so enjoy it this beach has a rich history and is thought to be where ancient Mariners landed ages ago and discovered the beautiful sites of the Turkish Countryside [Music] dear hope my trip was winding down and all of my worries from life started to creep in finishing College figuring out my future of course your father was a bright spot there but still I worried I'd spent my trip letting go and enjoying life growing up in some ways of course but it was coming to an end being here on this beach helped me relax I sat on the rocks and looked out over the water the sound was soothing I closed my eyes and let that sound those waves wash away my worries I have to admit I did that a lot afterwards too it became my technique I used whenever I was stressed or whenever we argued no matter your worries give it a try maybe it'll help you like it did me [Music] Mr Jeb you are back yeah I am what happened I thought you were going to help me I'm very sorry I was sick I almost went to hospital well glad you're feeling better now do you need anything sent to your room I I actually got to get on the next flight so thank you in the morning no no no there's got to be something tonight it's late for such departures but I will book something for you no no no um I'll take care of it but thank thank you I appreciate it uh it was wild Gabby but um everything is as it should be and I'm fine well do you need anything are you changing your flight no um I should be able to keep my schedule as is I've got one last stop in this and bow how's everything there Mrs Samuel's cat snagged one of her Birds the bird didn't make it but the cat looked very happy uh I'll have that one yes and one of [Music] those thank [Music] you dear Mom someone asked why I'd say if I wrote you back and it got me thinking why not my experience on this journey has probably not been what you thought it'd be I made a good friend and lost him too I wonder what you'd say about him where to start okay so you have absolutely no flights tonight okay well uh I'll do the 10:45 tomorrow then uh yeah yeah no I'm here okay uh perfect thank you [Music] good morning good morning your driver will be here in a few minutes perfect thank you I hope there are at least some good memories of to you can't take [Music] home [Music] yeah change your plans could you take me somewhere else [Music] [Applause] [Music] dear hope this s has some neat history behind it I remember I spent the day exploring all over Istanbul but this was the spot that made me stop and think I was so proud of how I fared on this trip I felt twice as confident and experienced in life and the world in a way I didn't know I could be I lived and that's what I want for you you are incredibly talented and hardworking but don't limit yourself with what you need no follow your heart trust your instincts I wish this was a trip we could have taken together maybe away from our normal routine and environment we could have broken out of our mold and stopped seeing the differences between us maybe we'd see each other in a new light but time's running out so I guess I'll just make sure you know the truth something I rarely said after our many squabbles over the years I love you and not because you're my daughter and it's expected but because you are amazing I love everything about you even your strength to hold your own when we argued never doubt that [Music] love I love you too Mom [Music] here you want a photo what are you doing here well this is one of the places to see in istan right couldn't come all this way and miss it I just I thought you would be on a Plane by now or back in Atlanta eventually but I had somewhere more important to be today where with [Music] you but what about your job it'll either be there when I get back or not but I do have the truth on my side and maybe it'll be enough well I mean you deserve everything you've worked for and I hope that they see that me too I uh I realized after you were gone that I never told you how grateful I was to have you by my side are you sure it was grateful instead of annoyed eventually but you made me feel safe and Dad e and I I found myself enjoying every minute of it even The Crazy Ones so thank you for that I was glad we were together too after all it was the best worst trip ever but I did make a mistake when I left you at the springs and you had to get back to estle did I I let everything I was afraid of with my job overshadow what I felt for you this morning I woke up thinking about that plane ride Fring the entire way home about my future but you're here because nothing that truly matters is on that plane or back [Music] home it's right here [Music] I like your logic yeah and I agree with it wholeheartedly [Music]\""
